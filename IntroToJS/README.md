# Introduction to JavaScript
Introduce JavaScript at a basic level. This should be a fairly light introduction. This lesson covers:

- `alert()` function
- variables
- `prompt()` function

### Note: `let` and `var`
In modern JavaScript, the `let` keyword [is preferred](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#description) over the `var` keyword in most cases. For the purposes of this course, the two keywords are all but interchangeable; however, `let` should be the standard.

## Icebreaker: Questions
Ask the students to answer the following questions:

- What are your favorite websites?
- What can you do to interact with those websites? E.g., clicking buttons, typing in fields, etc.

Discussion will take place during the lecture.

## Lecture 1: Introduction to JavaScript
The [first presentation](IntroductionToJavaScript.pptx) defines JavaScript and explains how developers use JavaScript.

## Lecture 2: JavaScript Variables
The [second presentation](JavaScriptVariables.pptx) dives in to the following concepts:

- `<script>` tag
- `alert()`
- Variables
- `prompt()`

## Code-Along Activity: Basic Chatbot
Have the students follow along to create a website that `prompt`s the user to answer a question and then displays an `alert` with a response.

## Self-Paced Exercise
Instruct the students to add more questions to their chatbot with the time remaining, e.g.:
- What's your favorite food?
- Who is your best friend?

## Survey
Have the students complete the [weekly check-in survey](TODO).
