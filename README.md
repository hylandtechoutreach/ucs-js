# Hyland JavaScript Academy @ UCS
This repository contains material for Hyland's continued partnership with Urban Community School.

## Learning Objectives
In this academy, students will use JavaScript to create interactive websites. They will practice applying essential programming concepts like variables, output, input, and conditional statements to build unique web applications.

_Note: In order to successfully participate, students must have solid skills in HTML & CSS (covered by Hyland Coding Academy in previous trimesters)._

## Outline
Here is an outline of the proposed lessons (subject to change as the trimester progresses).

1. **HTML and CSS Review** -- _Refresh some memories. See: [Web 102 - HTML & CSS Review](https://github.com/hytechclub/web-102/tree/master/HtmlCssReview)_
1. **Introduction to JavaScript** -- _If HTML is the body and CSS is the clothes, JavaScript is the mind. See: [Web 102 - Introduction to JavaScript](https://github.com/hytechclub/web-102/tree/master/IntroToJS)_
1. **Variables and Data Types** -- _Learn the building blocks of programming. See: [Web 102 - Data Types](https://github.com/hytechclub/web-102/tree/master/DataTypes)_
