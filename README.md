# Hyland JavaScript Academy @ UCS
This repository contains material for Hyland's continued partnership with Urban Community School.

## Learning Objectives
In this academy, students will use JavaScript to create interactive websites. They will practice applying essential programming concepts like variables, output, input, and conditional statements to build unique web applications.

_Note: In order to successfully participate, students must have solid skills in HTML & CSS (covered by Hyland Coding Academy in previous trimesters)._
