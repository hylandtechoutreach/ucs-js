# Review
A session to review the previous concepts.

## Warm-Up: Cookie Hacker
Demonstrate the [warm-up hackery](CookieHackerWarmUp.md) briefly for the students. They can try to follow along if desired, but it is not required. The goal of this is to show one way they can use JavaScript to interact with websites.

## Lecture: Concepts Crash Course
Present the [Review PowerPoint presentation](Review.pptx). It covers all the concepts from the course so far, in a condensed crash course style. The goal is for them to remember the basics and prepare for the Blooket activity.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/643e9a588b494d32698e3bdb). Note that an account is required to host the game.

## Team Review: Questions
For this review activity, every student will be on one team. Call on students one by one to answer the questions in the [slides](Questions.pptx). If they reach the proper points threshold, they can all receive candy.

There are **35** total points available. Some questions are worth multiple points - partial credit may be awarded.

## Self-Paced Work: Candy Farm
Students should follow [the instructions](CandyFarmSelfPacedWork.md) to fix some bugs and make some updates for a website about candy farming.
