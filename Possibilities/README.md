# Possibilities
This lesson is all about exploring more of what is possible with JavaScript. Students should learn about some new libraries, and customize some example projects.

## Introduction: PowerPoint
The [presentation](Possibilities.pptx) introduces a few different libraries and JavaScript capabilities. It also introduces the scavenger hunt.

## Self-Paced Work: Exploration
During this time, students should have the chance to play with some different examples. There are several examples:

- [Canvas](Canvas.md)
- [CSS Tricks](CssTricks.md)
- [jQuery](jQuery.md)
- [Phaser](Phaser.md)
- [Processing](Processing.md)
- [More](More.md)

### ðŸ”‘ Possibilities Scavenger Hunt
Scattered throughout the guides and examples are the answers to **10 questions** (available [here](ScavengerHunt.md)). If students are able to find all the answers and submit the form with 100% accuracy, they should receive candy.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/644fd7463164594825f519ce). Note that an account is required to host the game. Only allow the students to play if they were well-behaved and working hard.

This quiz reviews concepts from the previous lesson about [conditionals](../Conditionals/README.md).
