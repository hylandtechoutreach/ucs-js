# Phaser
The [Phaser framework](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser#phaser---html5-game-framework) is one way to make games with JavaScript.

## The Project
[Project Code](https://vscodeedu.com/Zv0Qo69HNDv23VsHWRLc) | [Live Site](https://hylandtechclub.com/showcase/UCS/Platformer/)

## Testing
Run the project and test out the site to see how it works.

## Updates
There are a few things you can try to change. Open up the **js/main.js** file to try to figure it out:

- Make the main character jump higher
- Make the main character run slower
- Make the main character animation faster
- Make the coin spin faster
- Make the gravity stronger
