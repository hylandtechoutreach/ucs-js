# The HTML5 Canvas
The [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element.

## The Project
[**Click here to view the Repl project.**](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Spring2017-Animation) Fork the project to begin.

## Testing
Run the project and test out the site to see how it works.

## Updates
There are a few things you can try to change. Open up the **script.js** file to try to figure it out:

- Make the square a different color than white
- Make the square smaller or bigger
- Make the square rotate in a bigger or smaller circle
- Make the square rotate faster or slower
- MINI-CHALLENGE: Make the square rotate counter clockwise by default instead of clockwise.
