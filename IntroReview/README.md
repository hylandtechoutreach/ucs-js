# Introduction Review
This lesson should reinforce the understanding of concepts covered in the [Introduction to JavaScript](../IntroToJS/) lesson.

## Learning Objectives

- Create `<script>` elements in HTML that link JavaScript files
- Display pop-up messages with JavaScript
- Create variables with JavaScript
- Ask questions to users with JavaScript

## Warm-Up: Munch Madness
This warm-up should help us determine what type of candy to buy. It is a candy tournament where students will vote for their favorite candy.

Use [this bracket](https://brackethq.com/b/uzgeb/) to facilitate the tournament. It will be necessary to log into Bracket HQ as Joseph, or create a new account and re-create the bracket. From there, start the tournament, click on each matchup, and have students vote on each winner!

## Team Repl
Instructors should follow [the instructions](TeamReplInstructorInstructions.md) to facilitate this activity.

## Self-Paced Exercises
Introduce the [self-paced exercises](SelfPacedExercises.md), and have the students work on it. During this time, encourage the students to be silent by teasing the review bracket seeding: if students are silent, they will be seeded higher, which means they will have an easier path to victory through the tournament.

## Review Tournament: Mocha Madness
This is the big review competition. Students will match up against each other in a double elimination tournament, where they "win" by answering a question correctly _before_ their opponent. Since this is a double elimination tournament, students will have at least two chances to stay in the tournament.

### Making the Bracket
The important thing with the bracket is that each student is added in some order, and that it is a double elimination bracket. The seeding of the bracket could play a significant role. It may be beneficial to start making the order during the self-paced exercises, determined by which students are well-behaved or working hard. One option could be to play the silent game during the exercises, and whoever makes noise first is added to the _bottom_ of the order.

Once the order is decided, use [Bracket HQ](https://brackethq.com/) to create a double elimination bracket. An account is required to create a bracket and start a tournament. Here is the information for the bracket:

- Name: Mocha Madness
- Type: Double Elimination
- Participants: All the students in the proper order
    - Top students may get a "bye" in the first round

Once all the students have been added, click the "START TOURNAMENT" button and begin!

### Questions
The questions are available in the [Mocha Madness](MochaMadness.pptx) PowerPoint slides. Each answer is revealed through a PowerPoint animation.

### Facilitating the Tournament
One **presenting instructor** should have two main windows up:

- The [Mocha Madness](MochaMadness.pptx) slides in presentation
- The bracket created prior

The presenting instructor should start from the bracket. This will determine which match-up to do next. Match-ups should be chosen first by round, and then by vertical order.

Once a match-up has been selected, the instructor should switch to the question slides. The **judging instructor** should invite the students up to the whiteboard. The question should be revealed, and the judging instructor will determine which student answered first. The presenting instructor should then go back to the bracket window, click the match-up, and check off the winner so they move to the next stage.

- There will be several match-ups in the "Loser's Bracket"
- If neither students are able to answer correctly, the question can be supplemented or simplified

### The Winner
At the end, only one student will be able to win. That student should receive candy.

## Kahoot
If there is time remaining, facilitate the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/4a6c1a18-b5cc-4a58-945f-4774fa9187e2).
