# Introduction Review
This lesson should reinforce the understanding of concepts covered in the [Introduction to JavaScript](../IntroToJS/) lesson.

- Create `<script>` elements in HTML that link JavaScript files
- Display pop-up messages with JavaScript
- Create variables with JavaScript
- Ask questions to users with JavaScript

## Warm-Up: Munch Madness
This warm-up should help us determine what type of candy to buy. It is a candy tournament where students will vote for their favorite candy.

Use [this bracket](https://brackethq.com/b/uzgeb/) to facilitate the tournament. It will be necessary to log into Bracket HQ as Joseph, or create a new account and re-create the bracket. From there, start the tournament, click on each matchup, and have students vote on each winner!

## DEPRECATED: Team Repl
We no longer use Replit, so this is not possible.

_Instructors should follow [the instructions](TeamReplInstructorInstructions.md) to facilitate this activity. Have students join the [Team Repl in Multiplayer mode](https://replit.com/join/qlopumkkfx-hylandoutreach), and then guide them through the process of updating the website project together._

## Self-Paced Exercises
Introduce the [self-paced exercises](SelfPacedExercises.md), and have the students work on it. During this time, encourage the students to be silent by teasing the review bracket seeding: if students are silent, they will be seeded higher, which means they will have an easier path to victory through the tournament.

## Review Tournament: Mocha Madness
Instructors should follow [the instructions](MochaMadnessInstructorInstructions.md) to facilitate this activity. Create a double elimination tournament bracket on [Bracket HQ](https://brackethq.com/) with all the students, and use the [Mocha Madness questions slides](MochaMadness.pptx) to have them face off against each other for each matchup.

## Kahoot
If there is time remaining, facilitate the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/4a6c1a18-b5cc-4a58-945f-4774fa9187e2).
