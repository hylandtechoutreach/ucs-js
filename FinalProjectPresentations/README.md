# Final Project Presentations
For the final Academy class, the students should present their projects, and finish up the trimester.

## Presentations
Students should have submitted their projects already (responses [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19i4sYOT4EaDRYvRjgWzx9s1pCY0I-fZoks5oIufHJL0/edit?usp=sharing)). Have them volunteer to present, or choose randomly. Click on their projects and present them from the main instructor laptop, or have them share their screens.

Each presentation should take ~2 minutes - keep them quick so there is time for the rest of the agenda items.

## Blooket
Facilitate the [review Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/64540fa3134520b655ddc7b3). This question set covers everything from the HTML/CSS trimester, and the JavaScript trimester. This should be an opportunity for students to review the material they should have learned in preparation for the end-of-trimester survey.

## End-of-Trimester Survey
Students should complete the [end-of-trimester survey](https://forms.gle/fw8vzhZjbDPf4y1x6). The link should be available on the [homepage](../BOOKREADME.md). There are also questions to gauge their retention from the trimester. Make sure each student completes the survey (responses [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dhYvNq2cUsy9OBBgR3j7-gcHSRbJO3G-cgBQ_3BB4i8/edit?usp=sharing)).
