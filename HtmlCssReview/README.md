# HTML & CSS Review
In this lesson we will review content from HTML and CSS.

## Icebreaker
Previous mad-libs icebreaker has been deprecated. Here's a new one: [mad libs](https://clay-happy-law-195.vscodeedu.app/).

## Code-Along: HTML & CSS Review
Walk through [the code-along instructions](HtmlCssReviewCodeAlong.md) with the students to create a fan web site. Go slowly to be sure everyone is following along.

If you end up with time left over, have the students change the site to be about something else.

## Kahoot
Run through this [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/details/0db7fccb-8b5f-46c3-a1db-4b123c0ac403) to gauge what the students ultimately remember from HTML/CSS.
