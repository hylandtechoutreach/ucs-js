# HTML & CSS Review
In this lesson we will review content from HTML and CSS.

## Icebreaker
ðŸ¤– Note: you will need an OpenAI account.

The [GPT-3 Mad Libs activity](https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/JQHsFLQt2yZuMc6VZfGDdR7K?model=text-davinci-003) is great for the first day because it allows the instructors to get familiar with saying and typing the students' names.

1. Go around the room and have each student say their **name** and a **fact** about themself, and type that into the top half of the prompt (replacing the sample list)
1. Go around again and, saying each student's name out loud, ask them to provide **a word** for the bottom half (any remaining category they want)
1. Adjust the temperature, submit, and read the results out loud for maximum enjoyment ðŸ˜„

If there are any issues, fall back to [this Mad Libs Icebreaker](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/ucs/blob/main/Icebreakers/MadLibsIcebreaker.md).

## Code-Along: HTML & CSS Review
ðŸ’¡ Note: the students should already be familiar with Replit, but if they need a refresher, direct them [here](https://hylandtechclub.com/ReplitSetup).

Walk through [the code-along instructions](HtmlCssReviewCodeAlong.md) with the students to create a Fortnite fan web site. Go slowly to be sure everyone is following along.

If you end up with time left over, have the students change the site to be about something else.

## Kahoot
Run through this [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/9da0c22b-48ae-479f-9c7f-c0bfd458a2b5) to gauge what the students ultimately remember from HTML/CSS.

## Survey
Have the students complete the [weekly check-in survey](TODO).
