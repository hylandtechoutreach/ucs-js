# Inspiration Day
Welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript! This day will be devoted to exploration and fun.

_**Your quest:** Decide what you would want to make if you could make anything._

## Creative Coding with p5.js and OpenProcessing
[p5.js](https://p5.js) is a friendly tool for learning to code and make art. It is a free and open-source JavaScript library built by an inclusive, nurturing community. p5.js welcomes artists, designers, beginners, educators, and anyone else!

[Click here to check out some of the wild possibilities of p5.js on OpenProcessing.](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending)

The coolest thing about these projects is that they are all open source - that means you can look at the code, and even copy it for your own project!

### Learning
[Click here for a p5.js tutorial.](https://p5js.org/tutorials/get-started/)

There are also some smaller examples to help you start coding with Processing.

#### Example: Embers
[Click here to view the Embers.](https://editor.p5js.org/jsmaxwelldev/sketches/8njuHkfZX)

Try to modify the code to make it your own! You can change the color, size, and anything else. For a fun challenge, try turning the embers into snowflakes - instead of floating up, have them fall down!

#### Example: Waves

Try to modify the code to make it your own! You can change a lot of different stuff.

## 3D Worlds with A-Frame
It is surprisingly easy to start building a 3D world on the web. [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a great tool for doing so, and you can create without ever leaving an **index.html** file. Here are some helpful resources:

- [Introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/)
- [Starter Project](https://vscodeedu.com/LkU7Ut9hexlxZMrtJF9t)
  - _note: the Preview does not work for A-Frame, projects must be Published and opened in new windows_
- [Cool Possibilities of A-Frame](https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/)
- [Environment Basics](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component)
- [3D Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/blob/main/Models/Models.md)
  - [Example](https://crimson-calm-kangaroo-558.vscodeedu.app) | [Source](https://vscodeedu.com/7Y6xqa2bLz9ZO6HLP142)

A-Frame is built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/), an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library.

## Games with Phaser
[Phaser](https://phaser.io/) is a game development framework that works with JavaScript.

- [Game Example: Platformer](https://wandering-fern-moth-328.vscodeedu.app/)
  - [Source Code](https://vscodeedu.com/vSnMpC4iN9JHbSZ3Gx8w)

[Click here to remix a platformer game on Glitch.](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/platformer-hacker/)

There's a [great book](https://glitch-game-makers-manual.glitch.me/) that introduces game development concepts using Phaser and Glitch - [click here for the web version of this in-depth walkthrough.](https://glitch-game-club.github.io/3m/)

## HTML5 Canvas
You can do a lot using the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
