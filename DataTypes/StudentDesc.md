# Data Types

> `Captain's Log, Stardate 48151.6`
>
> Today, we embark on a new mission to introduce young cadets to the fascinating world of JavaScript. Our lesson will focus on the essentials: variables, which allow us to store and manipulate information, and data types, specifically strings and numbers.
>
> These building blocks will enable our cadets to perform mathematical operations and explore the intricacies of combining data types, such as the bizarre and unexpected outcome of adding `4` and `"4"`... and getting `"44"`. Fascinating.
>
> Our journey will also touch upon the use of code comments, a powerful tool in any aspiring programmer's arsenal. I am confident that our cadets will rise to the challenge and boldly go where no programmer has gone before.

> `End log.`
