## Data Types
This lesson covers two basic data types in JavaScript: strings and numbers. It also includes a brief introduction to code comments.

## Icebreaker: Blooket
[Review the topics](TODO) from last lesson.

## Lecture: Data Types
The [presentation](DataTypes.pptx) introduces the following concepts:

- JavaScript comments
- Data Types in JavaScript (only strings and numbers for now)
- Math with numbers
    - Converting a string to a number

## Hands-On Activity: Variables Activity
During the lecture, after introducing variables, instructors can use this tangible representation of variables to help explain them. Use cups, nametags, and scraps of paper to represent what's happening in the computer.

- A **cup** represents a block of space in memory
    - It may be helpful to have multiple cups to indicate many blocks of memory
- A **nametag** represents a variable
- A **scrap of paper** represents a value

Place a **nametag** on a **cup** to represent _creating_ a variable. The nametag should have the name of the variable written on it.

Place a **scrap of paper** in a **cup** to represent _setting_ the value of a variable. The paper should have some text written on it.

Pull the **scrap of paper** out of a **cup** to represent _using_ a variable. After looking at the value, return the paper to the cup.

## Code-Along: TODO

## Review
Quiz the students on data types and values with the [review presentation](Review.pptx). Go really slow for the last few slides to make sure it's sinking in.
