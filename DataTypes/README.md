## Data Types
This lesson covers two basic data types in JavaScript: strings and numbers. It also includes a brief introduction to code comments (which is reiterated in the code-along).

## Warm-Up: Blooket
Run through the [JavaScript Basics Review](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/641cac24f3913d08035edfbd) blooket to refresh some memories.

## Lecture: Data Types
The [presentation](DataTypes.pptx) introduces the following concepts:

- JavaScript comments
- Data Types in JavaScript (only strings and numbers for now)
- Math with numbers
    - Converting a string to a number

_Note: template literals (sometimes called "[template strings](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/es6-template-strings/)" -- I'm rolling with that name) are likely an advanced topic for this class level so they are not part of the lecture. However, if a student is ready for that kind of added complexity, please direct them to [Template Strings](TemplateStrings.md)_.

## Hands-On Activity: Cups and Scraps
During the lecture, after introducing variables, instructors can use this tangible representation of variables to help explain them. Use cups, nametags, and scraps of paper to represent what's happening in the computer.

- A **cup** represents a block of space in memory
    - It may be helpful to have multiple cups to indicate many blocks of memory
- A **nametag** represents a variable
- A **scrap of paper** represents a value

Place a **nametag** on a **cup** to represent _creating_ a variable. The nametag should have the name of the variable written on it.

Place a **scrap of paper** in a **cup** to represent _setting_ the value of a variable. The paper should have some text written on it.

Pull the **scrap of paper** out of a **cup** to represent _using_ a variable. After looking at the value, return the paper to the cup.

Ask the students what happens to the old value when an existing variable gets set to a new value.

## Code-Along: Math!
Have the students follow along with a [JavaScript math experiment](CodeAlong.md). There is an additional challenge at the end in case there are superachievers in the class.
