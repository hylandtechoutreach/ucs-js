# Final Project Work
The students should all create their own final projects to show us what they learned.

## Introduction
Go over the [project description](StudentDesc.md). Make note of the different starting projects they can use:

- [Quiz About Me](QuizAboutMe.md)
- [Candy Clicker](CandyClicker.md)
- [Spongebob Soundboard](Soundboard.md)

Emphasize that they have to change the projects sufficiently to be successful.

## Project Work
Let students work on their projects independently. They can help each other, but each student should have their own individual project.

## Submissions
Students should [submit their projects](https://forms.office.com/r/p1NV1b4wjW) before the end of class.

Note that they will be asked to present their project next week.
