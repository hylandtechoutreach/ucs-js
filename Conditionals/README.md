# Conditionals
This lesson is all about conditional statements in JavaScript. These statements allow program flow to change based on true or false values.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize the boolean data type
- Use `if` statements to control program flow
- Debug broken conditional code

## Warm-Up: Chess Logic
For the warm-up, consider how a chess computer program might work. The most basic chess computer might have a number of _conditions,_ or responses to certain moves.

1. [Click here to play chess online](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/chess.html)
1. Set the **Black player** to be **Computer (Ruthless)**
1. Start an opening, then click **New Game** and do the same opening
1. Watch the computer player respond in the same way each time!

Explain that a chess computer has some pre-programmed responses depending on what a human player does. In reality, this is quite complex, but it all boils down to this:

>_If `this move` happens, I will do `this move`._

Play one full game of chess against the ruthless computer, with students helping determine which moves to make.

## Lecture: Conditional Statements
Present the [Conditionals PowerPoint](Conditionals.pptx). There is also a mini quiz within the slides.

## Self-Paced Work: Debugging
Introduce the [debugging activity](ConditionalDebugging.md). It may be worthwhile to introduce the idea of debugging in general as well.

Students should have a chance to play around with the site, and try to figure out how to fix some of the issues. It is okay if they do not fully complete the debugging, but hopefully they will be able to fix at least some of the bugs.

## Code-Along: Chatbot
Walk through the [code-along instructions](ChatbotCodeAlong.md) with the students to build a simple chatbot that can respond to a few messages.

There is also additional work the students can do on their own; they can add more responses, or work on [challenges](Challenges.md).
